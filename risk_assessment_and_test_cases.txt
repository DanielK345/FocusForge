# Focus Forge Blocker - Risk Assessment and Test Cases

This document outlines potential risks, test cases, and solutions for the Focus Forge Blocker application across its three main components: Frontend, Backend, and Chrome Extension.

## 1. Backend Risks and Test Cases

### 1.1. Server Availability and Stability

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Server fails to start | Attempt to start the server with incorrect configuration or missing dependencies | Implement proper error handling in the startup script; Add health check endpoints; Set up automatic restart mechanisms (PM2, systemd) |
| Server crashes during operation | Simulate high load or memory leaks by sending numerous concurrent requests | Implement proper error handling and logging; Set up monitoring and alerting; Use process managers like PM2 for automatic restarts |
| Database connection failures | Disconnect the database while the server is running | Implement connection pooling; Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff; Provide meaningful error messages to users |

### 1.2. API Security and Data Validation

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Unauthorized API access | Attempt to access protected endpoints without authentication | Implement robust JWT validation; Set appropriate token expiration; Use HTTPS for all communications |

| Rate limiting bypass | Send numerous requests in quick succession | Implement rate limiting middleware; Use IP-based and token-based rate limiting; Add CAPTCHA for suspicious activities |

### 1.3. Data Integrity and Validation

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Invalid calendar data | Submit events with invalid dates (e.g., end before start) | Implement thorough validation in models and controllers; Return clear error messages |
| Overlapping events | Create events that overlap in time | Add validation logic to prevent or warn about overlapping events |
| Excessively large inputs | Submit event descriptions or website URLs exceeding reasonable lengths | Set and enforce maximum field lengths; Truncate or reject oversized inputs |

| XSS vulnerabilities | Input HTML/JavaScript in text fields | Sanitize user inputs; Use React's built-in XSS protection; Implement Content Security Policy |
| Long text inputs breaking UI | Enter extremely long text in event titles or descriptions | Set maximum length for inputs; Truncate displayed text with ellipsis; Implement scrollable containers |
| Date/time selection errors | Select invalid date combinations | Use reliable date picker components; Validate date ranges; Provide clear guidance on date formats |

### 2.3. State Management and Data Flow

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|

| Memory leaks | Navigate between components repeatedly | Clean up event listeners and subscriptions in useEffect cleanup functions; Monitor memory usage during development |
| Network request failures | Test with unreliable network connection | Implement retry mechanisms; Cache previous successful responses; Provide offline capabilities where possible |
| Concurrent edits conflicts | Edit the same calendar from two different sessions | Implement versioning or locking mechanisms; Show warnings for potential conflicts |

## 3. Chrome Extension Risks and Test Cases

### 3.1. Installation and Initialization

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Extension fails to install | Attempt installation on unsupported Chrome versions | Specify compatible versions in manifest.json; Provide clear installation instructions |
| Extension fails to initialize | Start Chrome with extension enabled but no internet connection | Implement offline initialization with cached data; Show appropriate error messages |
| Permission issues | Deny required permissions during installation | Clearly explain why each permission is needed; Implement graceful degradation for missing permissions |
| Conflicts with other extensions | Install alongside similar extensions (e.g., other blockers) | Test for namespace conflicts; Use unique identifiers for all extension components |

### 3.2. Website Blocking Functionality

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Failure to block websites | Visit blocked websites during active blocking periods | Implement multiple blocking mechanisms (webRequest, content scripts); Add logging for debugging |
| Bypass attempts | Try to access blocked sites via different protocols or subdomains | Use pattern matching for URLs; Block at the domain level; Consider implementing DNS-level blocking |
| Extension disabled by user | Manually disable the extension during blocking periods | Implement a "lockdown mode" option that requires a password to disable; Send notifications to the user |
| Incorrect time-based blocking | Test blocking at the boundaries of scheduled periods | Ensure accurate time synchronization; Add buffer periods around scheduled times |

### 3.3. Critical Risk: User Unable to Cancel Blocking

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Emergency override failure | Attempt to use emergency override during blocking | Implement an "emergency access" feature with a cooldown period or one-time password |
| Extension corruption | Corrupt extension storage and attempt to disable blocking | Store critical data in multiple locations (local storage, sync storage, cookies); Add data integrity checks |
| Blocking persists after schedule ends | Check if websites remain blocked after scheduled end time | Implement time-based checks that run frequently; Add a background process to verify blocking status |
| User locked out of important websites | Try to access critical websites (e.g., work tools) during blocking | Create an allowlist for essential websites; Provide a temporary access mechanism with justification |

### 3.4. Synchronization and Data Management

| Risk | Test Case | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Failed synchronization with backend | Test with intermittent network connection | Implement retry mechanisms; Use local caching; Show sync status to users |
